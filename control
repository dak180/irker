Package: irker

Description: An IRC client that runs as a daemon accepting notification requests
 as JSON objects presented to a listening socket. It is meant to be
 used by hook scripts in version-control repositories, allowing them
 to send commit notifications to project IRC channels.  A hook script 
 that works with git, hg, and svn is included in the distribution.
