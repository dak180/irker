			KNOWN BUGS

We apologize for the rough edges on this software.  The initial release
was somewhat rushed by the sudden death of cia.vc in late September 2012;
a replacement needed to be fielded immediately.

* Testing has been minimal.

* There is one report of unexplainedly high CPU usage by irkerd when
  processing UDP requests.

* Despite what the header comment implies, the URL prefix and message template
  in irkerhook.py can at present only be modified by hacking the script.
