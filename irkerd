irkerd - a simple IRC multiplexer daemon

Listens for JSON objects of the form {'to':<irc-url>, 'privmsg':<text>}
and relays messages to IRC channels. Each request must be followed by
a newline.

The <text> must be a string.  The value of the 'to' attribute can be a
string containing an IRC URL (e.g. 'irc://chat.freenet.net/botwar') or
a list of such strings; in the latter case the message is broadcast to
all listed channels.  Note that the channel portion of the URL need
*not* have a leading '#' unless the channel name itself does.

Options: -d sets the debug-message level (probably only of interest to
developers). -l sets a logfile to capture message traffic from
channels.  -n sets the nick and -p the nickserv password. The -V
option prints the program version and exits.

Design and code by Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>. See the project
resource page at <http://www.catb.org/~esr/irker/>.

Requires Python 2.6 or 2.5 with the simplejson library installed, and
the irc client library at version >= 3.4 which requires 2.6: see

# Sketch of implementation:
#
# One Irker object manages multiple IRC sessions.  It holds a map of
# Dispatcher objects, one per (server, port) combination, which are
# responsible for routing messages to one of any number of Connection
# objects that do the actual socket conversations.  The reason for the
# Dispatcher layer is that IRC daemons limit the number of channels a
# client (that is, from the daemon's point of view, a socket) can be
# joined to, so each session to a server needs a flock of Connection
# instances each with its own socket.
#
# Connections are timed out and removed when either they haven't seen a
# PING for a while (indicating that the server may be stalled or down)
# or there has been no message traffic to them for a while, or
# even if the queue is nonempty but efforts to connect have failed for
# a long time.
#
# There are multiple threads. One accepts incoming traffic from all
# servers.  Each Connection also has a consumer thread and a
# thread-safe message queue.  The program main appends messages to
# queues as JSON requests are received; the consumer threads try to
# ship them to servers.  When a socket write stalls, it only blocks an
# individual consumer thread; if it stalls long enough, the session
# will be timed out. This solves the biggest problem with a
# single-threaded implementation, which is that you can't count on a
# single stalled write not hanging all other traffic - you're at the
# mercy of the length of the buffers in the TCP/IP layer.
#
# Message delivery is thus not reliable in the face of network stalls,
# but this was considered acceptable because IRC (notoriously) has the
# same problem - there is little point in reliable delivery to a relay
# that is down or unreliable.
#
# This code uses only NICK, JOIN, PART, MODE, and PRIVMSG. It is strictly
# compliant to RFC1459, except for the interpretation and use of the
# DEAF and CHANLIMIT and (obsolete) MAXCHANNELS features.  CHANLIMIT
# is as described in the Internet RFC draft
# draft-brocklesby-irc-isupport-03 at <http://www.mirc.com/isupport.html>.
# The ",isnick" feature is as described in
# <http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/draft-mirashi-url-irc-01.txt>.
