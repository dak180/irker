	irker - submission tool for IRC notifications

irker is a specialized IRC client that runs as a daemon, allowing 
other programs to ship IRC notifications by sending JSON objects to a 
listening socket. It is meant to be used by hook scripts in version-
control repositories, allowing them to send commit notifications
to project IRC channels.  Hook scripts are included.

Due to the abrupt death of cia.vc in later September 2012 the
inmitial release of this software was a bit rushed.  See the file
BUGS for known problems.
