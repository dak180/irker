	irker - submission tools for IRC notifications

irkerd is a specialized IRC client that runs as a daemon, allowing 
other programs to ship IRC notifications by sending JSON objects to a 
listening socket. 

It is meant to be used by hook scripts in version-control repositories,
allowing them to send commit notifications to project IRC channels.  A
hook script, irkerhook, supporting git, hg, and Subversion is
included in the distribution; see the install.asciidoc file for
installation instructions.

The advantage of using this daemon over individual scripted sends 
is that it can maintain connection state for multiple channels,
avoiding obnoxious join/leave spam.

Please read the files security.txt and hacking.txt before modifying
this code.
